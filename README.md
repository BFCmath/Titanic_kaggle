The original data is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview">here</a>  

It includes: *train.csv* and *test.csv*  
Here, I work mainly on train.csv
The problem is about Survival state prediction of passenger on Titanic  
What I have learned: 
+ using pyplot to plot bar graph better
+ using KFold for splitting CV datasets
+ comparing and visualizing many models 
+ first time implement gradient boosting, 3 kernel-trick SVM
+ learn to use FSB and FSF for feature selection
