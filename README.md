The original data is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview">here</a>  

It includes: *train.csv* and *test.csv*  
Here, I work mainly on train.csv  
The problem is about Survival state prediction of passenger on Titanic  
What I have learned: 
+ using pyplot to plot bar graph better
+ using KFold for splitting CV datasets
+ comparing and visualizing many models 
+ first time implement gradient boosting, 3 kernel-trick SVM
+ learn to use FSB and FSF for feature selection 

What I have remade: 
+ Detect overfitting in decision tree
+ Using early-stopping to reduce overfitting
+ Have a better insight about params of both RF and GD
+ Handle "unknown" data better
+ Boosting acc from 0.76 to 0.79
